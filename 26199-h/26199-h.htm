<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">When</span> I first saw you&mdash;never mind the year&mdash;you could speak no English,
and when next I saw you, after a lapse of two years, you <i>would</i> prattle
no French; when again we met, you were the nymph with bright and flowing
hair, which frightened his Highness Prince James out of his feline
senses, when, as you came in by the door, he made his bolt by the
window. It was then that you entreated me, with "most petitionary
vehemence," to write you a book&mdash;a big book&mdash;thick, and all for
yourself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Apollo heard, and granting half the prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shuffled to winds the rest and tossed in air."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I have not written the book, nor is it thick: but I have printed you a
book, and it is thin. And I take the occasion to note that old Geoffry
Chaucer, our father poet, must have had you in his mind's eye, by
prescience or precognition, or he could hardly else have written two
poems, one on the daisy and one on the rose. They are poems too long for
modern days, nor are we equal in patience to our fore-fathers, who read
'The Fa&euml;rie Queen,' 'Gondibert,' and the 'Polyolbion,' annually, as they
cheeringly averred, <i>through and out</i>. Photography, steam, and
electricity make us otherwise, and Patience has fled to the spheres;
therefore, if feasible, shall "brevity be the soul of wit," and we will
eschew "tediousness and outward flourishes" in compressing 'The Flower
and the Leaf' into little:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">I no man's property invade,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Corruption 's an unlawful trade;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But that would swell the year's supplies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An annual job or two might drop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We should not miss it 'midst the crop;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Civil List be less abused;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It might the ministry confound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet the State stand safe and sound.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Have been most clamorous for foods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turkey invasions have cost dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And geese were numerous last year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Really, these secrets told are ruin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tend much to the realm's undoing."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Again, without examination,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They thanked his good administration.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A third and fourth time this recurred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An auditor would then be heard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Are we but tools," he said, "of rogues?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through us corruption disembogues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mighty flood; for every grain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We touch we vouch at least for twain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where have they vanished? nay, in bribes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have depoverished our tribes."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then followed an investigation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a report unto the nation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Ant was punished, and his hoard&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that remained of it&mdash;restored.<br /></span>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> moralist, my dear niece, has said that&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">"The man of sense will read a work of note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the like humour as the author wrote."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">To which end we must try to identify the reign of King
George I. and the manners of that era with these fables;
for manners change with every age, and every age has its
transitions of political and social manners:</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">"Manners with fortunes, humours turn with climes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tenets with books, and principles with times."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">It was in the era of the two first Georges that Gay wrote and
applied these fables, filled with diatribes against ministers,
courtiers, and misers, and inveighing against court corruption
and bribery.</p>

<p>It was a period of transition, such as had before occurred,
from feudal to monarchial, and now from monarchial to
ministerial rule. We had entered into another phase&mdash;one
of civil and religious liberty; but, at the same time, the royal
court was a scene devoid of any graces: the kings could not
speak our language, and their feminine favourites were the
reverse of fair or virtuous; whilst domestic hate ruled in
the palace. Power then ran into a new groove of corruption
and bribery; and the scene, vile in itself, was made viler by
exaggeration and the retaliations of one political party on
the other, whilst either side was equally lauded by its own
party. Therefore we may reasonably conclude that matters
were not so bad as they were painted, and moreover that it
was but a change and transition of evils, to play a part and
disappear. The advent of the third George to the throne,
and the rigid integrity of the first and second Pitt, reversed
the story as read in these fables; the court became pure, the
king true, the ministers honest, and the nation progressed
from the miserable peace of Utrecht, in 1714, to the proud
position we held on its centenary at Vienna, in 1814. We
may grant, then, that Gay had reason on his side when he
inveighed so bitterly against courts and kings; and, granting
that, we may recognise the amelioration of the court of the
present day, wholly free from corruption and presenting a
school to be followed rather than contemned.</p>

<p>In the fable of the 'Degenerate Bees,' Gay takes the part of
the Tory ministry,&mdash;Oxford, Bolingbroke, Dean Swift, and
Mat. Prior; and in the 'Ant in Office' he alludes to a Whig
minister of that day. We must not be too hard on ministers.
Kings and the nation have been open to bribes and assenting
to French diplomacy,&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">Louis XI. purchased the retreat of Edward IV. in 1475,
when he seized on the domains of King R&eacute;n&eacute;&mdash;Provence,
Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and Lorraine, and Burgundy from
the domains of Charles the Bold; when we abandoned our
blood allies for bribes. Again, in 1681, Charles II. was the
pensioner of Louis XIV., when Louis seized on Strasbourg.
William III. reluctantly let it pass at the peace and treaty
of Ryswick, which Louis dictated; and it was very basely
abandoned by us at the peace of Utrecht, in 1714, when we
abandoned our ally the emperor, and the degenerate Bees of
the fable suffered exile and the Tower, barely escaping death
from the indignant nation. Again, in the treaty of Vienna,
1814, we sacrificed the interests of Austria to France, in
ceding to the latter the pillaged counties of the Messin and
of Alsace. Finding, therefore, like results from wholly
different causes, we must not be extreme to judge, but, with
Gay, admit the ministers of 1714 to grace, for they only then
did what we sanctioned in 1814, and which 1870 sees
righted, and the German towns restored to Germany.</p>

<p>I am now rounding off half a century in which I have
wandered in this wilderness of a world, and in all that time
I have never known, or heard of, corruption in a minister of
state. I have seen and known many fall untimely to
ministerial labours and responsibility. Walking through
the streets and squares we may behold the noble brows of
Pitt, Canning, Lord George Bentinck, Sir Robert Peel, Lord
Palmerston&mdash;men "on whose brows shame is ashamed to
sit"&mdash;and, we might add, another Canning, a Follett, Sir
George Lewis, and a hecatomb of Colonial rulers, who have
died, overtasked by toil and responsibility; but in all that
time we have never heard a minister accused of corruption,
or building palaces, or making a fortune from public treasure.
Corruption, if so it may still be termed, has taken another
phase; it has bowed its head and courted democracy, like to
the Roman king, Ancus Martius, "nimium gaudens popularibus
auris"&mdash;cringing to popular suffrage&mdash;to ride into
place and power, by granting measures momentarily floating
uppermost, and suffering the tail to guide the head, as did
the snake in &AElig;sop's fable. We attained the height of
grandeur of 1814 under the guidance of the head, and we
are now upon our trial of democratical government, and
whether it be equal to the old. Under such auspices
commerce has been the petted minion of the last thirty years.
Not the native forest tree of Pitt, Huskisson, and Canning,
but the hot-bed plant of the advocates of a predominant trade.
No British statesman ever dreamt of restricting commerce,&mdash;which
ever was the bond of unity of nations; but we have
sunk every interest at home to swell the exports and imports,
to make Britain what Egypt was in the days of the patriarch&mdash;the
storehouse of the world. Egypt and England
both put their agriculturists to pain, and the rural population
to serfdom; but they only exchange the stable basis of well-being
for an unstable one, for commerce is proverbially of a
fleeting nature.</p>

<p>The age in which Gay wrote was eminently what we now
designate as conservative. Excise was hateful then; as
customs are denounced now, so home taxation was denounced
then. So wonderfully do systems change, that in
the monthly table of the revenue of this period (December,
1870), the customs do not raise one-third of the revenue, of
which the other two-thirds are raised by home taxation.</p>

<p>From ministers proceed we to the misers. I doubt whether
any domestic changes have wrought so great an amelioration
in our well-being as banks and banking. It has saved us
from burglars; it has, by cheques, redeemed us from the
tyranny of tradesmen's books. It has put personal property
on a stronger foundation than it held, and the banker keeps
an excellent private account, gratuitously, of your receipts
and expenditure. The trouble that the possession of gold
gave to its possessor before this wonderful institution was
brought to bear, may be told by a few instances of divers
epochs. There is a tale of a man who was supposed to have
discovered the treasures of Cr&oelig;sus, in the treasury&mdash;such as
is shown now at Mycen&aelig; and Orchomenos as the treasuries
of old. The hero of the tale having discovered the crypt
and its hoard, built another, and spent half of his life in
secretly removing the treasures of Cr&oelig;sus to his new
treasury; which was no sooner a deed accomplished than he
perceived the original treasury was superior to the new, and
he spent an equal amount of years in secretly restoring the
treasures to their original crypt, where doubtless they are
now, for he died whilst he was the slave to the gold.
Herodotus has stories quite as marvellous as this, of the
fortunate finder of the treasures of Cr&oelig;sus. But our friend
Mr. Pepys&mdash;who, I believe, has given us more amusement
than any other Englishman, be he whom he may&mdash;is more
amusing and instructive. His story is written in 1667, the
year after the fire of London, and whilst the invasion of the
Dutch was apprehended, and we will see how Mr. Pepys
fulfilled the adage of "as much trouble as all my money."
On 30th March, 1666, we find him write:&mdash;"I to Lombard
St., and there received 2200<i>l.</i>, and brought it home, and,
contrary to expectation, received 35<i>l.</i> for the use of 2000<i>l.</i>
of it for a quarter of a year, where it hath produced me this
profit, and hath been a conveniency to me as to care and
security at my house, and demandable at two days' warning,
as this has been."</p>

<p>On 12th November: "This day I received 450 pieces of
gold, which cost me 22&frac12;<i>d.</i> change. But I am well contented
with it, I having now nearly 2800<i>l.</i> in gold, and will not rest
till I get full 3000<i>l.</i>" But on the 13th June, 1667, on the
sad news of the taking of the 'Royal Charles,' and sinking
ships at Barking Creek, "put me into such a fear, that
I presently resolved of my father's and wife's going into the
country; and at two hours' warning they did go by the coach
this day with 1300<i>l.</i> in gold in their night-bag. Pray God
give them good passage, and good care to hide it when they
come home! But my heart is full of fear. They gone, I
continued in frights and fear what to do with the rest."</p>

<p>And on the 10th October, when the Dutch were gone, we
read:&mdash;"Up, and to walk up and down in the garden with
my father, to talk of all our concernments: about a husband
for my sister, whereof there is at present no appearance; but
we must endeavour to find her one now, for she grows old
and ugly. My father and I with a dark lantern, it being
now light, into the garden with my wife, and there went
about our great work to dig up my gold. But, Lord, what a
tosse I was for some time in, that they could not justly tell
where it was: but by-and-bye, poking with a spit, we found
it, and then began with a spudd. But, good God! to see
how sillily they did it, not half a foot under ground, and in
the sight of the world from a hundred places, and within
sight of a neighbour's window. Only my father says that he
saw them all gone to church before he began the work when
he laid the money. But I was out of my wits almost, and
the more from that, upon my lifting the earth with my spudd,
I did discern that I had scattered the pieces of gold in the
loose earth, and, taking up the iron head-pieces whereon
they were put, I perceived the earth had gotten among the
gold, and wet, so that the bags were all rotten and notes; so
that I could not tell what in the world to say to it, not
knowing how to judge what was wanting, or what had been
lost by Gibson in his journey down, which, all put together,
did make me mad. And at last I was obliged to take up the
pieces, dirt and all, by candle-light, and carry them into my
brother's chamber, and there lock them up, whilst I eat a
little supper; and then, all people going to bed, William
Hewer and I did, all alone, with pails of water and besoms,
wash the dirt off the pieces, and then began to tell them, by
a note which I had of the value of the whole in my pocket,
and do find that there was short above a hundred pieces,
which did make me mad.... So William Hewer and I
out again about midnight, and there by candle-light did
make shift to gather forty pieces more; and so to bed, and
there lay in some disquiet until daylight. 11th.&mdash;And then
William Hewer and I, with pails and a sieve, did lock ourselves
into the garden, and did gather the earth and then sift
those pails in one of the summer-houses (just as they do for
diamonds in other parts), and there, to our great content did,
by nine o'clock, make the last night's forty-five up to seventy-nine;
so that we are come to some twenty or thirty of what I
think the true number should be. So do leave my father to
make a second examination of the dirt, and my mind at rest
on it, being but an accident; and so give me some kind of
content to remember how painful it is sometimes to keep
money as well as to get it, and how doubtful I was to keep it
all night, and how to secure it to London.</p>

<p>"About ten o'clock, took coach, my wife and I, and Willett
and W. Hewer, and Mumford and Bowles (whom my lady
sent me to go along with me my journey, not telling her the
reason, but it was only to secure my gold), and my brother
John on horseback; and with these four I thought myself
pretty safe. My gold I put into a basket, and set it under
one of the seats; and so my work every quarter of an hour
was to look to see whether all was well; and I did ride in
great fear all the day. 12th.&mdash;By five o'clock got home, and
did bring my gold to my heart's content very safe, having
not this day carried it in a basket, but in our hands; the
girl took care of one, and my wife of another bag, and I the
rest, I being afraid of the bottom of the coach lest it should
break." Such is Mr. Pepys' story.</p>

<div class="block">

<p>Mr. Crabbe has portrayed the marvel of an honest inhabitant
of Aldborough, when first he learnt, in his graphic
phrase, "that money would breed,"&mdash;that it could afford to
pay yearly interest. Shakespeare has several references to the
fact. Shylock, and a clown in 'Twelfth Night' making
very quaint allusions. I shall only add one more tale from
Mr. S. Trench's late stories of 'Realities of Irish Life.' A
neighbour, who had saved two hundred pounds in gold,
kept it in the thatch of his roof. One day he appeared
before Mr. Trench bearing his gold, and requesting him to
be his depositee, expressing the comfort it would afford him.
Mr. Trench declined the unprofitable duty, and pointed out
to him the bank, which would accept his deposit and give
him interest. The eye of Patrick flashed with intelligence
and foresight as he warned Mr. Trench from the delusion of
banks, which every year wasted the original sum by paying
the stipend, and when you wished to reclaim the original, lo,
it had disappeared. No, no, he would have no dividend, forsooth,
to eat away his capital; which he bore back again
(about five pounds' weight) and replaced it in his thatch. It
was neither lost nor wasted there; it became the inheritance
of his only daughter, a woman of extreme energy, who had
from childhood loved&mdash;more, methinks, as a mother loves a
helpless child&mdash;a good-hearted, unvicious piece of indolence
and sloth. She followed him to New York and married him,
<i>nolens volens</i>; and Providence assigned to him an energetic
woman, to make his castle of indolence a bed of roses to the
satisfaction of them both,&mdash;supplying for each the energy and
the repose, both constitutional, both unvicious, which the
other lacked.</p>

<p>Highwaymen beset the highways, as burglars invaded the
residences; and Macaulay chuckles over the fact that his <i>b&ecirc;te
noire</i>&mdash;the noble Marlborough&mdash;was eased of 5000<i>l.</i> in gold
in one of his trips between London and St. Alban's.</p>

<p>From the regions of ministers and misers we may descend
to the equally disputed realms of the muses. Horace terms
it "the peevish and inhuman muse," which those who drink
of Aganippe's fountain woo; whilst others are apt to equal
their Castalian spring and Parnassus with the height of the
empyreal, regarding with pity the toilers on the land and
deep. But herein, as in aught else, it is the mind, and not the
outward circumstances, which makes the happiness suited to
its strength and position; for it must be confessed it is from
the weak in bodily frame, the lame, and the blind, that we
draw our poets: and when we find a rare bodily exception to
the rule, we find too often a mind insatiate of applause, and
pining for more appreciation of their productions. The
votaries of the muse cannot be set down as so happy and
contented as many a ploughman, nor does the smoothness of
the lines gratify the eye more than the smoothness of the
furrow. But these rhymes of Gay hardly aspire to the height
of poesy, nor do they possess the banter and raciness, such as
we find in Butler's 'Hudibras':&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">And trudge away to bawl, 'No bishop!'"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">Neither has it the deep pathos of the Spenserian stanza,
which perhaps strives at the deepest vein of poetry. Take
two of Thomson's, for example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">"O mortal man, who livest here by toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not complain of this thy hard estate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That like an emmet thou must ever moil,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, certes, there is for it reason great;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though sometimes it makes thee weep and wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curse thy star, and early drudge and late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withouten that would come a heavier bale,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loose life, unruly passions, and diseases pale."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And another stanza runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">"I care not, Fortune, what you me deny:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You cannot rob me of free Nature's grace;<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Such is the <i>stanza</i> in which are written Spenser's 'Fa&euml;rie
Queen,' Thomson's 'Castle of Indolence,' and Byron's
'Childe Harold,' and it is the highest flight of poetry: after
which comes the heroic verse, in which we lap the heavy
poems we call epic&mdash;their Latin appellation; of these the
Iliads of Homer and the &AElig;neids of Virgil are the ever
recurring aspirations of poets doomed to fall untimely.
The charm of Homer is that it is not only a poem, but it
instructs us in the history&mdash;all that we know of it&mdash;of those
prehistoric days. It is full of ballads, which are the ground-work
by which we trace the manners and the tenets of the
pagan tribes. The truth involved in 'Homer' is the charm
of his epic poem, while the falsehood involved in the
'Henriade' of Voltaire is amply sufficient to condemn it
utterly. For a specimen let us take Pope's 'Homer,' where
Hector answers Andromache's appeal to stay and guard the
walls of Troy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">

<p>Nursery rhymes, old ballads, odes, sonnets, epigrams,
travesties, fables, satires, and eclogues, and, most of all,
songs, provide daily pleasure for us from our cradle to the
grave. Every language has its nursery rhymes, which are
a sort of Delphian lot, sung in enigma from 'King Pittacus
of Mytilene' and 'Le bon Roi Dagobert,' to the lullaby of
'Four-and-twenty Blackbirds.' There is as much sarcasm in
nursery rhymes as there is of pride and boast in the songs
of bards at the feast of heroes, and as there is of humble
confession in the funeral psalm. Song tends alike to evaporate
exuberant spirits, and to soothe the soul in an affliction&mdash;as
Desdemona informs us so sweetly in her misery:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">

<span class="io">"My mother had a maid called Barbara;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An old thing 'twas; but it expressed her fortune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she died singing it. That song to-night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will not go from my mind: I have much to do,<br /></span>

<p>Ophelia chanted as she floated down the brook, Arion

<p>But of every species of poetry none are so rife with life
and beauty as the song. It conjoins music with words, and
brevity with sweetness. There is no position in which man
does not sing,&mdash;in joy to express it, and in woe to relieve it:
in company in chorus, and alone for companionship. Sir
Walter Scott has imagined the minstrel to sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">"I have song of war for knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay of love for ladye bright,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If you pity kith or kin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the wandering harper in."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">But songs are like the flowers of the field: each age hath its
own, which fade and perish and make way for another crop,
and every age claims its own. For melody, terseness, and
beauty of words, the song excels more than any other form
of poetry; and they are wise who have a private collection of
the songs which, like swallows, come and disappear.</p>

<p>It may appear strange to print the Fables of Gay, and say
no word of our author; but the truth is that it is unkind to
withdraw the veil of privacy from any man's life. Doctor
Johnson did an unkind deed when he wrote the 'Lives of
the Poets;' for which he was fully repaid when Boswell
flayed him bare as ever Apollo flayed Marsyas, and exposed
all the quivering nerves to the light of day. Of all classes
of men, the class of poets most need the concealing veil: the
greatest have been blind; the next greatest halt, and the remainder
weak or deformed of frame. Debarred the healthier
paths of life, man rushes for employment to the refuging
muse; and rightly so, for he finds an employment ornamental
and useful still. But solitude does not nurture the
virtues of the soul more than physical defect does that of
the body, and the withdrawal of the curtain divulges a very
sad sight of discontent and envy. Homer himself is recorded
to have ejaculated his aspiration to be the favourite of the
Greek girls and boys. A poet seer loves no brother near
his throne, and is but too apt to complain of non-appreciation
of his muse on the part of the world. The fault rather
is in their own too sensitive souls; and it is a fact that there
is scarcely a name in the roll of poets, whose fame is not
harmed by divulging his exotic life. The rural labourer's
fate&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Where to be born and die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rich and poor, make all the history"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">is far better than to be paraded from the disobedience of
youth, the rebellion of manhood, and the disappointment of
age, divulged in the storied lives of the few hundred names
admitted to be British poets; and the reading of whose works
is, as a rule, a task of weariness. The career of Gay is a
very fair one as an average of the poetic. He mainly avoided
the enumerated ills&mdash;enumerated by Dr. Johnson&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the jail."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">The poetic element in Britain was very strong in the days of
Gay. Pope, Swift, Prior, Addison were the petted servants
of the Ministers. They were all far more successful in their
careers than was Gay, who from his boyhood refused to
labour for his bread. Very early he found a patroness in the
Duchess of Monmouth, who had</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wept over Monmouth's bloody tomb,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">with whom he enjoyed a sort of honorary post&mdash;secretary to
the shadow of a princess; next he became a real secretary
to the Earl of Clarendon, Ambassador at Hanover, as Prior
had been to the Ambassador at Paris. We easily trace in
Gay's career the unsatisfied overweening poetic soul, like
a Charybdis, insatiable of adulation. In 1716, the Earl of
Burlington cheered him at his seat in Devon; in 1717, he
accompanied Mr. Pulteney to Aix; in 1718, Lord Harcourt
soothed his spirits. Then he made money, which burnt holes
in his pockets. He called his friends together, to ask how he
should invest. His poetic friends Pope and Swift advised
him to sink it in an annuity. But fate or fortune cast him
in with Secretary Craggs and the South Sea scheme, and,
from the possessor of 20,000<i>l.</i>, his capital collapsed to <i>nil</i>.
In vain he had been bidden to sell and to realize. He had
visions of wealth, and held on to be accidentally an honester
man than if he had enriched himself by that delusive scheme;
but he nearly sunk beneath his disappointment, and his health
was endangered. Hope and the Muse restored him to more
life and to more disappointment. He then wrote 'The Captive,'
obtained an appointment to read it to the Princess of Wales,
stumbled, like C&aelig;sar, over a stool; the princess screamed,
the omen was a true one&mdash;'The Captive' pined and died.</p>

<p>In 1726 he wrote these Fables, dedicating them to the
Duke of Cumberland, and in 1727 his royal patron succeeded
to the crown; when he was offered the post of
Gentleman Usher to the Princess Louisa. Gay was hurt
and indignant, and made court to Mrs. Howard (afterwards
Countess of Suffolk), one of the anomalous favourites alluded
to in page 131, but in vain.</p>

<p>Then came the great success of his 'Beggars' Opera,'
which was followed by 'Polly,' its sequel. 'Polly' was
forbidden by the Lord Chamberlain, and a private subscription
raised 1200<i>l.</i> to recompense Gay for not being suffered
to please the mob with his immorality. And, lastly, the Duke
and Duchess of Queensberry took this child of nature by
the hand&mdash;the duke to manage his worldly substance, and
the duchess to soothe his insatiable vanity&mdash;and so he died
at the early age of 45, and has a very pretty tomb, with
"Queensberry weeping o'er his urn," in Poets' Corner.
Pope's epitaph runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">"Blest be the gods for those they took away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those they left me, for they left me Gay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left me to see deserted genius bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neglected die, and tell it on his tomb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his blameless life the sole return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My verse and Queensberry weeping o'er his urn."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">Peace with his dust! Another couplet of Pope's, methinks,
has more of moral truth and justice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">"A wit's a feather, and a chief's a rod;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An honest man's the noblest work of God."<br /></span>
</div></div>
